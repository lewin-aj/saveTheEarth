					<a href="crisis-in-our-forests/index.html" rel=noopener><strong>A Crisis In Our Forests</strong></a> by Mark Naughton (2001)<br><br>
					<i>Little by little, the forests succumb to the chainsaw and the axe, wielded by loggers whose only fear is that the beautiful tree they are killing, will fall on them. How can humankind direct its attention to something so beautiful yet savage and plunder it for all the resources they can find? Mark Naughton explains.</i><br>
					<br>				
					<a href="effects-of-destruction/index.html" rel=noopener><strong>Effects of Destruction</strong></a> by Denise Tansley (2001)<br><br>
					<i>With instant global news available more so in the last ten years, we are more aware of the environmental changes happening around the world and the effects it is having on the Earth. Although the Earth has always had natural disasters, we are now in grave danger of tipping the balance to the point of no return. Never before in our lifetime has humankind destroyed the one thing that has kept us alive, the great Rainforests of the Earth. Denise Tansley explains what will happen if the rainforests are not saved.</i><br>
					<br>
					<a href="spirit-of-the-trees/index.html" rel=noopener><strong>The Spirit Of The Trees - A True Story</strong></a> by Denise Tansley (2001)<br><br>
					<i>This is a true account of what happened to Mark and I and our neighbours in July/August 2001 and how the Spirit of the trees led us to help them.</i><br>
					<br>
					<a href="waste-recycling/index.html" rel=noopener><strong>Waste &amp; Recycling - Reduce, Reuse &amp; Recycle</strong></a> by Save Our Earth (2001)<br><br>
					<i>We all produce rubbish, whether we like it or not. With the increased awareness of recycling, we wanted to write about what you can recycle and how.</i><br>
					<br>
					
					<a href="law-and-trees/index.html" rel=noopener><strong>The Law And The Trees</strong></a> by Denise Tansley (2002)<br><br>
					<i>Did you know that apart from speed limits, tax evasion and other laws that we have to abide by (well in England), there are also laws to govern trees. But, these laws are not always widely known and through lack of knowledge of the law, they are not used. This list is not intended for quotation in actual law, but serves as a step forward to protecting the rights of the trees, and to raise our awareness.</i><br>
					<br>
					
					<a href="rebalancing-life/index.html" rel=noopener><strong>Rebalancing Life</strong></a> by John Nickson (2006)<br><br>
					<i>This article is produced because I donâ€™t believe that the Kyoto Protocol goes far enough to adjust the problems we face today. Although the aim is to reduce pollution and greenhouse gases, I feel that it is too little, too ineffective, and will take too long. John Nickson explains.</i><br>
					<br>				
					<a href="animal-testing/index.html" rel=noopener><strong>Talking Point - Animal Testing</strong></a> by Denise Tansley (2006)<br><br>
					<i>I was horrified to learn that the charity, Cancer Research UK tests on animals; I heard from a friend some years ago but thought that they were mucking around with me knowing how I loved animals and how sensitive I was, but reading on the text on TV I was shocked, they confirmed it was true. Here we list companies that test on animals and those that do not. Denise Tansley explains more.</i><br>
					<br>
					
					<a href="climate-change-warnings-predicted/index.html" rel=noopener><strong>Climate Change warnings predicted in 1992 by Ann Walker &amp; White Arrow</strong></a> by Mark Naughton (21st July 2007)<br><br>
					<i>Fifteen years ago, Ann Walker and White Arrow warned us what we should expect if the rainforests were not saved.</i><br>
