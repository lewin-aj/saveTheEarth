				<h2>Effects of Destruction</h2>

					With instant global news available more so in the last ten years, we are more aware
					of the environmental changes happening around the world and the effects it is having
					on the Earth. Although the Earth has always had natural disasters, we are now in grave
					danger of tipping the balance to the point of no return. Never before in our lifetime
					has humankind destroyed the one thing that has kept us alive,  the great Rainforests 
					of the Earth.<br>
					<br>
					The real killer to the environment is carbon dioxide. Those of you not aware of the
					process and believe me, not many people are, carbon dioxide that is emitted into the
					air from sources such as transport, machinery and industrial pollution and an 
					increasing population and with such a build up of chemical emissions, they need to go
					somewhere. <br>
					<br>
					Due to drilling for oil and precious stones and the increasing supply for timber, the
					rainforests are being destroyed at an alarming rate. Now the trees do a miraculous job
					for us, they suck up the carbon dioxide and release oxygen which in turn cleans the
					air for us to breath. With all these factors, we are in fact creating a huge greenhouse
					effect and it does not stop there.<br>
					<br>
					With trees being felled each day, whether in one region or another, this has a 
					major impact globally. As the forests are deluged with over a metre of rainfall a year,
					this is evaporated into the atmosphere and cools the Earth. As each tree falls, this
					process is interrupted and the Earth's global temperature goes up another percentage
					of a degree. This has an adverse affect on the polar ice caps which begin to melt more
					rapidly.<br>
					<br>
					With the Earth heating up and the ice caps melting, sea levels are rising and cities
					being flooded, possibly disappearing over night. There is also another danger within
					the seas of the Earth.<br>
					<br>
					The ocean 'conveyor belt' transfers warm, less salty water from the Pacific to the Atlantic
					as a shallow current and returns cold, more salty, water from the Atlantic to the Pacific
					as a deep current. <I>(Source: Hothouse Earth - The Greenhouse Effect & Gaia by John Gribbin,
					1990)</I><br>
					<br>
					The conveyor belt is in danger as with the Poles melting, more and more fresh water is 
					being released into the system and when the system switches off, Europe will freeze in
					an Ice Age! There is already evidence of this happening now. Scientists have studied the
					cod fish which lives in salty water. They found that where the fish once thrived, they
					now do not and investigations have revealed that this is due to fresh water in the once
					salty water, hence the cod fish cannot survive. We have all the evidence in front of us,
					yet we still choose to close our eyes to the biggest problem we will ever know on Earth.<br>
					<br>
					Recently the World's richest nations gathered at the G8 summit to discuss emissions 
					and although there are steps being made in the right direction to cut emissions, not
					enough is being done. The rainforests are still being destroyed and we need to act NOW. 	
					The governments of the World are not doing enough to secure the planets survival, we are
					always finding a cure instead of prevention but this has to change. We as the people of
					this Earth all have a voice and we need to use it to come together to save the great
					forests, they save our lives and without them we have no hope at all.<br>
