					The tropical rainforests are the most natural, beautiful and diverse places on the Earth. They are home to many rare birds, plants and animals, contributing around 50 to 80% of 
					the species on the Earth. Today they are termed as 'The Lungs of the Earth' and two thousand years ago, 'The Gardens of Eden'. Within the last forty years we have managed 
					to destroy seventy percent of these Ancient Forests.<br>
					<br>
					It takes an average of 300-500 years for a tree to firmly establish its roots with a maximum height for some of the trees reaching 200ft - you can easily see why it takes this
					long and yet minutes to destroy. With the size of Wales being destroyed each year for products such as toilet paper, newspaper, writing paper and furniture, the forests are
					becoming more like deserts than the lush forests they once were.<br>
					<br>
					Latitude and rainfall distinguish tropical forests from temperate (or moderate climate) forests which are found in warm climates but not too hot to be called tropical. Temperate
					forests are at ground elevation, mainly in North America, Europe and cooler Australasia. There are many types : deciduous woodland, coniferous woodland, Mediterranean woodland, mangrove 
					and temperate rainforest.<br>
					<br>
					<div style="width:100%; height:100%;">
					<center>
					<img class="rainforest-map" src="../images/map2.jpg" bofder="0" alt="Save Our Earth - Rainforest Map" title="Save Our Earth - Rainforest Map"><br>
					</center>
					</div>
					All tropical rainforests lie between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn. They receive more water and temperature due to their location in the monsoon regions. There are many different kinds of tropical rainforest:
					tropical evergreen, tropical moist deciduous, cloud forest, lowland rainforest and peaty swamp forest.<br>
					<br>
					Rainforests may grow in thin and sterile soil. This is achieved by ample sunlight and water, and nutrients from decaying plant matter. In the warm damp conditions, dead plants rapidly
					decay by bacterial or microbial action, releasing the nutrients.<br>
					<br>
					The forests are a closed ecosystem where everything is recycled but once these forests are opened, the decaying matter is cleared, the moist conditions disappear and slowly the 
					forest loses its ability to sustain itself.<br>
					
					
					<div class="styled-line">
						<hr class="hr-text" data-content="Purpose">
					</div>
					The main purpose of the rainforests is to act as the breathing apparatus for the world's climate, hence their name the "Lungs of the Earth". They produce the majority of the World's 
					oxygen. Each tree soaks up twice as much carbon dioxide than when it is felled. Without these controls, carbon dioxide is not held in check and as each acre of forest is destroyed, 
					the forests reduce their ability to soak up water. The rainfall is disrupted and the land becomes dry. This, in turn, affects the distribution of water and changes the wind 
					patterns across the Earth. 
					<br><br>
					<div style="width:100%; height:100%; float:center; padding:10px; clear: both;"><center>
						<IMG SRC="../images/costarica.jpg" border=0  ALT="Save Our Earth - Costa Rica" TITLE="Save Our Earth - Costa Rica"><br>
					</center></div>
					Due to their precise positioning in the monsoon regions, the Rainforests attract heavy rainfall - but <b>how does this help the climate?</b>
					The Rainforests can absorb large quantities of carbon dioxide and emit oxygen into the atmosphere. The Earth's tilt also has a part to play in this. The Rainforests
					are situated in an area of the Earth which gets regular sunlight so they are very warm (and humid, due to the rain). As the rain falls in this region, it helps to
					cool the Earth.
					<br><br>
					<div style="width:100%; height:100%; float:center; padding:10px; clear: both;"><center>
						<IMG SRC="../images/tilt.jpg" border=0 ALT="Save Our Earth - Earth Tilt" TITLE="Save Our Earth - Earth Tilt"><br>
					</center></div>
					To mention the Earth's tilt again. The Earth's tilt in axis of rotation is normally 23.5 degrees from the perpendicular to the orbit plane.
					But the Earth's tilt is out by 3 more degrees causing instability within the core. If this increases to 5 degrees then unpredictable results will happen.
					As you will read later, if all of the Rainforests are destroyed by 2012, then there is no way this catastrophic error can be corrected.
					<br><br>
					If the climate is affected due to warmer temperatures and changing wind patterns coupled with the disappearing forests, the rain is unlikely to fall in sufficient
					quantities in the right places that would cool the Earth. These areas would then be more prone to flash floods and mudslides where other areas would experience wildfires and drought. Remember what the Rainforests did for
					us - where's the carbon dioxide going to go? Where's the oxygen going to come from? Why are breathing-related diseases on the increase?
					<br><br>
					An interesting point can be raised here. What about the forests of Europe, USA and Canada? These are just as important to help maintain life on Earth but as they are
					primarily temperate forests (grow at higher latitudes), they do not attract enough water to cool the Earth. These forests are also under threat from logging corporations
					who do not use sustainable practices.
					<br><br>
					Scientists consider global warming as the effect on the temperature and climate of the Earth but does anyone consider the Earth's core?
					<br><br>
					As the crust and mantle are several thousand kilometres thick, what would the effect be? Imagine this...<b>You are standing next to a central heating radiator - how long before the radiator's heat becomes too uncomfortable and you have to move?</b>
					<br><br>
					<div style="width:100%; height:100%; float:center; padding:10px; clear: both;"><center>
						<IMG SRC="../images/earthgw.jpg" border=0 ALT="Save Our Earth - Climate Change" TITLE="Save Our Earth - Climate Change"><br>
					</center></div>
					If we apply this to the Earth.....<br>
					<br>
					Sunlight is reflected back into space from the Earth's oceans and is trapped within the	atmosphere by greenhouse gases. These gases are water vapour, carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, ozone and methane which 
					absorb heat, thereby warming the Earth. If there wasn't a natural greenhouse effect, the Earth's temperature would be -18 degrees Celsius instead of the present 14 degrees Celsius.
					<br><br>
					How long will it take before we see the effect?
					<br><br>
					It can be said that this situation will take years - OK, point taken. But how short a time will it be if the current estimates that we have until all of the
					Rainforests are destroyed and with them, our primary system for carbon dioxide absorption, oxygen supply and cooling of the Earth?
					<br><br>
					As the Earth becomes warmer, we will see evidence of more volcanoes, earthquakes, floods and unusual weather - just look at the News media. A semi-argument simmers. Surely this is the Natural Earth?
					Our answer would be that volcanoes that have lain dormant for years suddenly erupt without warning or unexpected earthquakes that hit cities or floods, outside the monsoon season,
					that kill thousands. It is only what we see that we can tell. If we do not act to stop the destruction of the Rainforests, the climate pattern known as El Nino will appear to be
					very inconsequential indeed.
					<br><br>

					<h3>The Earth's Temperature</h3>
					The second point raised from our initial discussion, is of temperature increase. Scientists state that the global temperature will rise by 2.5 to 10.4 degrees Celsius
					(2016 was the hottest year on record) over the next one hundred years, on top of the one degree that we are experiencing now! (It is even stated that as the sea surface
					temperature gets warmer, El Nino climate patterns will become more intense and frequent).
					<br><br>
					In next 5 years, will the current predictions still be true or will the global temperature increase by 5 degrees?? As we saw above, the Earth is getting warmer and this brings new
					problems. When the temperature increases, and the Earth's tilt changes, we have the	danger that the polar ice caps will melt, thereby raising sea levels by hundreds of feet.
					Along with the mass extinction of animals and plants, the map of the Earth will be irreversibly changed.
					<br><br>
					Now as the polar ice caps melt, all of the frozen freshwater enters the conveyor belt system that circulates warm water around the Earth. The cold freshwater will dilute the
					warm salty water and effectively turn off this system. We will then experience an Ice Age.

					<br>
					<h4>Medicines</h4>

					It is astonishing to think that of the drugs we use today, most of the common ones are derived from plants in the rainforests - more astonishing is that only a small amount of the plants have been screened 
					for medical use. The following is a list of drugs that the plants have provided a basis for: the contraceptive pill, antibiotics, tranquillisers, dental cement, heart and ulcer drugs. 
					<br>
					<br>
					In fact one in four products from the chemist contain chemical compounds derived from rainforest plants. 70% of anti-cancer plants originate from the rainforests and the US National Cancer Institute identified
					3,000 plants with properties in fighting cancer.
					<br>
					<br>
					From 1960-1990, the survival rate for child leukaemia rose from 20% to 80% when 'The Rosy Periwinkle' plant from Madagascar played a major contribution in fighting this form of cancer. The Cinchona tree from Peru has been effective in treating malaria; the
					Guatemalan wild yam is a major contribution to the effectiveness of the contraceptive pill; Resperine from South East Asia, from the shrub Rauwlfia Serpentina is used for treating hypertension. Cement used
					in dentistry comes from the balsams of Latin America. The 'Benzoin Tree' of Malaysia produces a yellow substance that is used for antiseptic and to treat bronchitis. This is the Earth's own medicine cabinet with
					many more cures for illnesses hidden within the forests.
					<br><br>
					With the pharmaceutical companies making billions in profits each year, it seems that it is in their interest that the forests no longer survive, but the forests provided the basis for all of man's drugs and we should start preserving them now.
					<br>


					<div class="styled-line">
						<hr class="hr-text" data-content="Destroy">
					</div>		
					There are many contributors to Rainforest destruction. They are not in any particular order as over the past 20-30 years, they have all contributed to the loss of over 
					70% of the World's Rainforests. Natural resources have also been plundered to pay off loans to the World Bank and IMF. Access roads are built to extricate the trees,
					carving their way through the forests, getting deeper each time. These bring people deeper into the forests and into contact with new diseases. Ebola 
					and Aids are said to originate in the forests and it was Man venturing into them that brought disease into the cities and towns. Man also brings his diseases into the 
					forests and to the native Indians. Thousands of native indigenous people have died from flu, measles and colds.
					<br>
					<br>
					<h4>Timber Industry</h4>
					Trees are logged both legally and illegally to supply the timber trade. The industry is worth billions as the insatiable demand for wood in Japan, 
					Europe and USA grows. There are governments who sell acres of forests to companies for a pitance in the premise that local workers are employed. Other governments 
					have even offered their forests as payment for weapons!
					<br><br>
					In South America, in particular Brazil, criminal gangs have entered protected Indian reservations and felled trees. These are then passed into the market with 
					false certification. Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth have been instrumental in making the World aware of this problem. Yet, the problem still exists in other 
					countries/areas such as South East Asia. Even Russian temperate forests are suffering due to the demand for timber from Japan.
					<br><br>
					Now consider the impact of a tree being felled. Despite noise pollution from the chainsaw, the tree falls to the ground, striking surrounding trees. Wildlife 
					is disrupted, plants are destroyed; the ecosystem is wounded. In Vietnam, soldiers were pelted with stones as they tried to prevent villagers from illegally logging trees.<br>
					<br>
					<h4>Mining</h4>
					Corporations have bought mining rights to areas of forest so they can drill for diamonds, gold and other precious minerals. The workers who get paid a pittance 
					are just as much losers as the trees. The ecosystem suffers terribly as chemicals that are used to clean and lubricate drill bits, are washed into the 
					rivers, polluting and killing everything it touches.<br>
					<br>
					<h4>Oil and Gas Exploration</h4>
					With our thirst for oil at an all-time high, corporations are buying up prospecting rights in the forests. After a location has proved valuable enough, the 
					drilling rights are sold and more trees are felled with wells being erected in the pursuit of 'liquid gold'. For all the reasons that mining destroys the forests,
					oil and gas exploration are the same.<br>
					<br>
					<h4>Paper Industry</h4>
					There are conflicting views about whether trees are specifically felled to supply the paper industry. Moreover, after trees are felled for the timber industry (for 
					furniture, building materials etc), they are cut and whatever is discarded from this process is put through a chipping machine (for bark chippings for gardens) or 
					made into pulp. This pulp is then used in the manufacturing process of paper. Any smaller trees that are felled during the extraction of the larger trees are used for 
					paper. The reason - wood is used as virgin pulp to make paper whiter and stronger as DEFRA, the UK agency, reports that paper can only be recycled so many times before 
					the structure of the paper breaks down.<br>
					<br>
					<h4>Farming</h4>
					Trees and the ecosystem are savagely attacked by farmers using 'slash and burn' techniques. Areas of forest are cleared by fires in the view that the lush ecosystem 
					that exists, and the ash from the burning trees, will provide fertile soil for crops. This is true <u>but</u> <b>it is only for a year</b> when the rains will wash the nutrients 
					and the soil away. The farmers then move to another area and continue the process. The fires in Indonesia in 1998 were blamed on farmers and despite millions of acres of 
					rainforest being destroyed, and South East Asia being blanketed in a thick smog for a few months, no-one was prosecuted. The pollution from this sitiuation had consequences 
					as heavy rains turned the hills into deadly mudslides.<br>
					<br>
					It now seems the largest problem facing the rainforest ecosystem is from soya and palm oil farming. The former product is primarily used for cattle feed, 
					where as the latter is used in the food and cosmetic industry. Millions of tonnes of soya are grown with the intention of feeding animals - surely this could 
					be grown elsewhere or is it the low price that attracts so many Western countries to purchase from the likes of Brazil?<br>
					<br>
					Is it really worth it just to grow - unsustainably - bananas, cocoa, coffee, rubber and palm oil? If you buy any of these products then make sure they are 
					Earth-friendly, for you could be unwittingly helping to contribute to the demise of the forests.<br>
					<br>
					<h4>Cattle Ranching</h4>
					Land is cleared in much the same way as above, and cattle are sent to graze. This cattle are used to supply the multi-billion dollar beef industry in the US 
					and Europe in which Brazil is increasing its share. We received information from <b>Aloke Barua</b> who had been researching this subject. One article was by 
					<b>Ronald Cummins</b> who presented a case for The Environment against the main US burger companies who were/are part of the 'Hamburger Connection' which was 
					threatening Costa Rica and Guatemala. <br>
					<br>	
					From Ronald's CV, he is well qualified on Costa Rica & Guatemala and investigative journalism. He found that McDonalds and Burger King while claiming to support 
					rainforest preservation and maintaining that they buy no hamburger meat from recently deforested areas, they were an integral part of an industry that if left unchecked 
					threatened to destroy rainforests in Central America. He quoted a statement from a journalist for the UK newspaper, The Observer, that quotes McDonalds as saying they 
					would not buy beef from rainforest areas that were deforested within the previous 10 years (their policy to 1988) or 25 years (their policy from 1989). <br>
					<br>
					He notes that meat imported into the US from rainforest areas is mixed with domestic meat in processing plants, and McDonalds admits that they were complicit in 
					destruction prior to 1988. <br>
					<br>
					Ronald further states that 10 or 25 years is not enough for a rainforest to regenerate naturally. He found that US companies such as Cargill, Iowa Beef Processors and Con-Agra, 
					use alternative suppliers in Argentina, Central America and Australia as blackmail to keep prices that they pay to US ranchers as low as possible - yet the US domestic market 
					produces a surplus! Since 1984 in Guatemala, he observed farmers moving from deforested land and ranchers moving in. In this way, neither the rancher or the US company will 
					accept any blame for felling the trees. <br>
					<br>
					Ronald suggests, along with RAN, that the only policy to preserve the rainforests is to ban all beef imports from countries containing rainforests.<br>
					<br>

					Forests that are burnt will not return again as the ground is not fertile enough and nothing will grow; 
					it will be like a house gutted after a fire. Something that has taken thousands of years to grow, cannot return in the time needed to save the planet.
					The forests normally receive up to 200 centimetres of rain a year but this will soak into the ground and flood the area causing mud and land slides.
					<br><br>
					In 1988 the great floods of Thailand alerted the government of the dangers and implications of forest clearing. A study 
					carried out in the Ivory Coast region found that in a landslide, a forested slope lost 0.03 tons per hectare per year where as a deforested
					slope lost 138 tons of soil per hectare per year. You can also add the levels of carbon dioxide that are released into the 
					air when forests are burnt.
					<br><br>
					Based on a 1992 study, figures showed 15-20% of carbon dioxide was emitted into the 
					air and ten years later, you can double that and then add the emissions from the Industrial Age and fossil fuels and 
					that the percentage gets higher and higher. As the forests continue to be destroyed and emissions are not cut drastically, we will see such diverse 
					weather patterns like never before with famine, drought and disease, extreme flooding and this is only the beginning...

					<b>2) Recycled Paper</b>
					<br><br>
					Ask your company or paper suppliers to switch to paper made from post consumer waste. In the USA, students forced their University to drop Staples as a supplier because 
					they didn't sell recycled paper. With pressure from RAN and grass-roots activists, Staples have announced they will be stocking recycled paper.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>3) Encourage better practices in Land Management</b>
					<br><br>
					If farmers were given improved training in land management, then better use would be made of existing agricultural areas.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>4) Sustainable Forestry</b>
					<br><br>
					Villagers in one country were given control of their neighbouring forest. As they depended on the forest for their survival, the trees were sustainably felled and 
					sold for money for the village. In this way, the ecosystem was allowed to rejuvenate. Sustainable forestry can work and does work - only buy wood from sustainable sources.
					Use sustainable and certified wood in projects and building. Even better, find and use discarded wood which has been recycled. 
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>5) Cattle Ranching</b>
					<br><br>
					If cattle is used to supply the beef industry, then it should not graze on deforested land, whether 10 or 25 years ago. Fast food companies should act 
					responsibly and should prove that they do just this.
					<br><br>

					1) Find any products that are produced from the rainforest, those that are not of a sustainable nature and refuse to buy them. Search for alternatives that do not harm
					the forests.
					<br><br>
					2) Support and join environmental groups and campaign to save existing woods and forests.
					<br><br>
					3) Help to plant trees in your area. Scientists have reported that planting billions of trees could remove enough carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and
					help to bring climate change under control - see <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/04/planting-billions-trees-best-tackle-climate-crisis-scientists-canopy-emissions" target=_blank rel=noopener>
					Tree planting 'has mind-blowing potential' to tackle climate crisis</a>.
					<br><br>
					4) Start recycling. Speak to your council about recycling facilities. Paper, cardboard, plastic bottles, glass, cans and wood can be recycled. Use recycled paper and recycled
					toilet paper - the more we use, the cheaper it becomes and companies will change their policies due to our societal pressure. <b>And importantly, recycle responsibly - it is your task to put it in the bin correctly.</b>
					<br><br>
					5) Re-use plastic bags. It takes over 30 years for one plastic bag to biodegrade. This means in our present environment with millions of plastic bags everywhere, we will still see ones
					in our sixties that we used when we were teenagers! Take your own bags to the shops so if anyone asks if you want a plastic bag, refuse and fill your own. Encourage supermarkets to
					stop the free supply of plastic bags, use cardboard boxes which can be recycled more easily.
					<br><br>
					6) Use electronic communications and non-paper learning resources.
