						<strong>The following text from the Report was given to Ann Walker by White Arrow in 1992.</strong>
						<br><br>
						&ldquo;It is not easy for me to tell you of bad that will happen. These things I do not wish to bring you. 
						I would have wished to bring you happy news on my return but instead I have to tell you of the troubles 
						that lie ahead. With your help I can save you. Then I can bring the good. Help my father to help you. 
						<br><br>
						&ldquo;I have already told you that your Earth has moved two degrees out of its orbit. In twenty years time 
						it will move another three degrees because of the rainforest destruction. This will make a five degree 
						change. Already the two degree move has altered the molten fluids beneath the earth’s surface. This in 
						turn is causing fault lines to shift, which is why you experience more earthquakes around the world. 
						As the next twenty years come so will you see new fault lines appearing and yet more earthquakes will 
						shake the land. Large areas of the planet will be totally destroyed. Land will submerge. Japan and 
						small islands will disappear. Parts of Russia will disappear. The southern tip of South America will 
						disappear. Many miles of coastline will be submerged into the seas and parts of land will be lost 
						over all the world.
						<br><br>
						&ldquo;The Earth is becoming warmer because the damaged ozone layer now allows the sun’s rays to heat the 
						planet with greater intensity. The core of the earth is overheating. In thirty years time many 
						species of animal will be lost. Man will find parts of his world changed. Your moon which already 
						affects the tides of the ocean will have an effect twenty times greater by then. Tidal waves that 
						have never been seen by man before will cover the land. The fish that you catch will move to 
						different parts of the ocean and be no longer there to feed you. Your crops will not grow because 
						the weather will change. There will be storms, cyclones and tornadoes in parts of the world where 
						they have never been known. Great rainstorms will flood the land and destroy not only crops but 
						grazing land as well and the moon, being too close, will have an effect here too. All land will 
						be affected because the earth’s atmosphere will be too close to the atmosphere of the moon. They 
						will be too close because of the five degree change.
						<br><br>
						&ldquo;The ice caps will melt and the seas will claim the shorelines of many countries. Between thirty and 
						fifty years from now an ice age will appear over many parts of the world while in other parts 
						temperatures will rise to over two hundred degrees. Great fires will destroy more forests and grazing 
						land will be burned. In thirty years there will be few safe areas in the world, yet even these 
						will be of little use to man, for in fifty years no safe place will be left. 
						<br><br>
						&ldquo;As the trees are being destroyed, so are the grasslands being taken away for roads and buildings. 
						Petrol fumes, among other things, are destroying the ozone layer in your atmosphere and affecting 
						the health of man. In twenty years time, twice as many cars and factories will produce ten times as 
						much pollution, and destruction to the ozone layer will continue causing further heating of the 
						earth’s core. We have a formula to help with this problem. We have given all the facts and figures 
						in The Report, but the cause of all this happening lies with your continued destruction of the 
						trees that give you life. As each tree falls so your destruction comes closer. The trees keep you 
						alive. They play an important role in the balance of life. Trees take in carbon dioxide and give 
						out oxygen. Without oxygen you and other breathing life forms cannot survive. Humans take in 
						oxygen and give out carbon dioxide. Without trees you cannot exist. Even the grass you walk on 
						and the flowers you admire give you breath. The rainforests are like a belt around the earth. 
						Even their weight plays an important part in how the earth spins in balance. Removing the trees 
						will cause a five degree change in the planet’s orbit around the sun. The trees are also a force 
						field. Winds from one part of the planet are kept away from another part by the trees. They cause 
						a direction that makes it safe. Without the trees the winds are left to follow their own direction 
						causing them to grow stronger and further damage the earth without the force to hold them back. 
						Diseases will be carried from different countries. They will not be contained because the winds 
						and weather will be out of control and the ozone layer will again play a big part in your destruction.
						<br><br>
						&ldquo;It is the felling of the rainforests and other things that have mainly caused the problem we see. 
						Man must take responsibility for his actions. His actions are adding to his own destruction in 
						fifty years’ time. 
						<br><br>
						&ldquo;I will now talk about the object that is coming. The comet will not hit your earth. Its pathway 
						has already been mapped out to pass your earth. I know for I have seen this but you must hear: 
						the atmosphere of your earth and your moon will be too close together and so will be in the comet’s 
						path. As the comet passes its speed and weight will pull the middle of the earth outwards causing 
						it to erupt. Lands will sink and mountains will come down. Land man has never seen will appear in 
						the place of lands that have gone. No man will walk the earth again for millions of years to come. 
						This is why I have returned to you, to turn back to God and help him to repair the damage before 
						it is too late. 
						<br><br>
						&ldquo;We have eighteen years only to do this in: ten years to stop the felling of trees and eighteen 
						years now to start replanting the forests. This will bring the earth back from the five degree danger.
						<br><br>	
						&ldquo;I want my people to know the truth. You shall show them The Report and they shall know that 
						it was to be for everyone so that everyone will know. With this knowledge that I give, the people 
						can be informed and, once informed, can cause change.&rdquo;
						<br><br>
						<b>This report was written in 1992 and was sent to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on 
						Climate Change in 1992. They responded, stating that the report was indeed 50% correct &mdash; 
						but could not verify the remaining 50% due to the nature of the evidence and the fact that it had not happened yet.</b>

						<h3>Warning Signs Are Happening Now</h3>

						<strong>Europe and England</strong>
						<br>
						Presently, the overwhelming influences on Europe’s climate are the Atlantic Ocean, the cold land-mass of Asia and the warm air 
						mass over the ocean with its warm Gulf stream. The Gulf stream is so effective in elevating temperatures that, mountains apart,
						where the Atlantic and Saharan influences coincide in southern Spain, winter temperatures presently can be as high as Florida – 
						ten degrees of latitude or 700 miles farther south.
						<br><br>
						England will be an indication of the severity of upcoming changes that Europe will experience, during process. In the year 2012 
						there will be nationwide crop losses. The temperature, twenty years hence, in England will begin at 120F and constitute the 
						start of the irreversible stage of temperature increase. Throughout England, at this time, there will be widespread flooding, 
						together with a phenomenon of frequent large-scale fires that may be likened to the spontaneous fires which occur in 
						Canada/North America after prolonged arid conditions.
						<br><br>
						<strong>Twenty five years ago</strong>, Ann Walker and White Arrow warned us what we should expect if the rainforests were not saved. 
						The year 2012 has changed. Ann said in her book <strong>The Messenger The Messiah</strong> that due to continued deforestation and the
						shift in the Earth's axis, the process had been brought forward five years to 2007! We cannot be complacent. Since 1997,
						climate records have been broken whether its the wettest June, the hottest year, the warmest Winter - these are not one-off
						occurances. During Summer of 2007, 2008 and now Autumn 2009, the UK experienced severe thunderstorms and flooding which hit all parts of England, Wales and 
						Scotland. Homes were flooded, transport networks ground to a halt and crop losses were reported. On 20th July 2007, over
						one month's rain (100mm) fell in one day in Oxfordshire. Many more disasters have befallen the people of Earth in this time. 
						<br><br>
						In 2007, The Met Office reported the severe storms that lashed the UK had been caused by the jetstream that moved to a lower latitude 
						around the UK which had led to frequent low pressure areas, leaving us with numerous storms - but no-one explained why these weather 
						patterns changed! Read the article about how Rainforest deforestation has changed wind patterns on <a href="../index.html" rel=nopener target=_blank>saveourearth.co.uk</a>.

						<br>
						In November 2009, Dumfries in Scotland had its wettest month on record. In 2009, the Met Office reported that 2009 will be in the 'top five warmest years' since records began 150 years ago.
						<br><br>
						And more recently in 2017, several category 4 and 5 storms have hit the continental United States and Mexico along with a 8.1 magnitude earthquake striking Mexico. How much more devastation must we endure before changes are made?
